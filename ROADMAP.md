# Roadmap

## How to Use This

Pick any unclaimed task. Create a branch. Submit a PR. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for standards.

Tasks are ordered by dependency — work higher in the list before lower. Tasks within a section can often be parallelised.

**For automated implementers:** See `docs/implementation-order.md` for the strict dependency DAG with compilation-order tasks, acceptance criteria, and the implementer loop.

**Status key:** DONE | IN PROGRESS | NEEDED | BLOCKED (by what)

## Phase 3: Communication Protocol — DONE

Inter-primitive communication is the event graph itself. Primitives communicate by emitting events (via `AddEvent` mutations), and the tick engine routes those events to primitives whose `Subscriptions()` patterns match. This is already fully implemented:

- [x] **Message passing** — primitives emit typed events, tick engine delivers to subscribers
- [x] **Listen/Say** — `Subscriptions()` defines what a primitive listens for; `AddEvent` mutations are how it speaks
- [x] **Routing** — tick engine matches event types to subscription patterns, respects layer ordering
- [x] **Knowledge architecture** — per-tick snapshots (context), primitive state (memory), lifecycle mutations (structural change)

The subscription contracts for all 201 primitives are specified in `docs/primitives.md`.

---

## Phase 4: Layers 1-13 — DONE

156 primitives across 13 layers (12 per layer, 3 groups of 4). Each implements the Primitive interface with correct layer, subscriptions matching `docs/primitives.md`, and state-tracking Process methods. All mechanical implementations — intelligent behaviour (IIntelligence, IDecisionMaker) will be wired when those interfaces are needed.
