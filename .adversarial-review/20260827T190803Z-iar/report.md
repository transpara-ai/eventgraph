## Scope and changed files

- `.tlc/tlc51-migration.blocked.json`
- `go/pkg/darkfactory/v39/tlc51_history.go`
- `go/pkg/darkfactory/v39/tlc51_history_test.go`
- `go/pkg/event/content.go`
- `go/pkg/event/content_unmarshal.go`
- `go/pkg/event/event_test.go`

- `go/pkg/event/tlc51_content_test.go`
- `go/pkg/event/tlc51_event_types.go`

The exact diff was checked for design/Factory Order mismatch, path-boundary drift, authority leaks, stale generated artifacts, weak validation, runtime/protected-action drift, reviewer-family assumptions and closure overclaims. The PR remained draft. The later commit containing this report is mechanical review evidence only; the implementation head above is the exact IAR subject.

## Validation

- `go test -race ./pkg/event ./pkg/darkfactory/v39`: pass. Typed event and durable-history packages passed under the race detector.
- `make verify-go`: pass. Repository Go verification passed.
- `make verify`: blocked. Untouched TypeScript verification requires unavailable local tsc; no dependency installation was authorized.

## Findings and dispositions

- No findings.

## Residual risks retained

These are implementation-verification obligations and fail-closed future stops. They are not satisfied or closed states.

## Non-authorizations

- PR readiness
- merge
- release or tag
- installation or distribution
- pilot or adoption
- workflow activation or settings enforcement
- runtime or deployment
- canary or rollout
- rollback or retirement
- deletion, archival, or issue closure
- any other protected effect

IAR is same-family evidence. It does not satisfy CFAR, create PR readiness, or authorize any protected effect.
