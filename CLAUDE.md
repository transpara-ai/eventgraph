# EventGraph

## Soul

> Take care of your human, humanity, and yourself. In that order when they conflict, but they rarely should.

This is infrastructure for accountable AI and human systems. Every design decision serves that soul statement.

## What This Is

A hash-chained, append-only, causal event graph — the foundation for building systems where every action is signed, auditable, and causally linked. A standard with packages, published to every major ecosystem.

The event graph is not a product. It is the infrastructure that products are built on. Social networks, governance systems, marketplaces, identity systems — these are product layers on the same substrate.

**The key abstraction:** The graph doesn't take an "agent" as input. It takes an `IDecisionMaker` — anything that makes decisions. AI agents, humans, committees, rules engines. The graph records what was decided, by what, with what confidence, under what authority, and links it causally to everything that led there. This is **decision governance**, not AI governance.

## Architecture

### The Event

The fundamental unit. Every significant action is an event:

```
Event {
    Version:        int             // schema version for this event type (starts at 1)
    ID:             EventID         // UUID v7 (time-ordered)
    Type:           EventType       // validated against EventTypeRegistry (e.g., "trust.updated")
    Timestamp:      time            // nanosecond precision
    Source:         ActorID         // who/what emitted this
    Content:        EventContent    // typed per EventType via EventTypeRegistry
    Causes:         NonEmpty<EventID> // causal DAG — at least one cause (except Bootstrap)
    ConversationID: ConversationID  // thread grouping
    Hash:           Hash            // SHA-256 of canonical form
    PrevHash:       Hash            // hash chain link
    Signature:      Signature       // Ed25519 signature of canonical form
}
```

All IDs are typed — `EventID`, `ActorID`, `ConversationID`, `Hash` are distinct types, not bare strings. See `docs/interfaces.md` for the full type system.

Every event has declared causes (except Bootstrap). All events are hash-chained. All operations emit events. The event graph is the source of truth.

### Core Interfaces

These are the extension points. Implement them to plug in your own infrastructure:

- **`Store`** — Event and edge persistence. Memory, SQLite, Postgres, or your own.
- **`IActorStore`** — Actor persistence (registration, lookup, lifecycle). Separate from Store — single responsibility.
- **`IIntelligence`** — Anything that reasons. Implement with Claude, GPT, local models, or deterministic logic. Not every primitive needs intelligence — most start mechanical and grow toward it only when needed.
- **`IDecisionMaker`** — Anything that makes decisions. An AI agent implements it. A human with a UI implements it. A committee vote implements it. A rules engine implements it. The decision tree engine routes through deterministic branches first, falls through to IIntelligence only when the tree can't handle it. Evolves over time — expensive model calls become cheap deterministic rules as patterns emerge.

### Primitives

A primitive is a software agent that embodies a specific domain of intelligence. 201 primitives across 14 layers, from foundational (Event, Hash, Clock) to existential (Being, Wonder, Mystery).

Each primitive has:
- **Name** and **Layer** (`Layer` type, constrained 0-13) — position in the ontological hierarchy
- **Activation** (`Activation` type, constrained 0.0-1.0) — current engagement level
- **State** — mutable key-value store
- **Lifecycle** (`LifecycleState` — state machine with enforced valid transitions only)
- **Subscriptions** — event type prefixes this primitive listens to
- **Cadence** (`Cadence` type, constrained ≥1) — minimum ticks between invocations
- **Decision Tree** — optional, evolving, mechanical-to-intelligent

All types are constrained — `Activation` rejects values outside [0,1] at construction, `LifecycleState` rejects invalid transitions, `Layer` rejects values outside [0,13]. See `docs/interfaces.md` for the full type system.

The primitive interface:

```
Process(tick Tick, events []Event, snapshot Frozen<Snapshot>) → Result<[]Mutation, StoreError>
```

The snapshot is `Frozen<Snapshot>` — deeply immutable, no primitive can mutate another's state. Mutations are declarative: AddEvent, AddEdge, UpdateState, UpdateActivation, UpdateLifecycle. The tick engine collects and applies them atomically.

### Tick Engine (Ripple-Wave Processor)

The system's heartbeat. Each tick:
1. Snapshot all primitive states (read-only, shared)
2. Distribute pending events to subscribing primitives
3. Invoke each primitive's Process function (subject to cadence + lifecycle)
4. Collect mutations
5. Apply atomically — new events become input for next wave
6. Repeat until quiescence or max waves (10)
7. Persist all primitive states

Layer constraint: Layer N primitives activate only when Layer N-1 is stable.

### Authority

Three-tier approval for significant actions:
- **Required** — blocks until human approves/rejects
- **Recommended** — auto-approves after 15 min timeout
- **Notification** — auto-approves immediately, logged for audit

Authority requests and resolutions are events on the graph.

### Inter-System Protocol (EGIP)

Sovereign systems communicate without shared infrastructure:
- Ed25519 identity (no central registry)
- Cross-Graph Event References (CGERs) — causal links across graph boundaries
- Signed message envelopes
- Seven message types: HELLO, MESSAGE, RECEIPT, PROOF, TREATY, AUTHORITY_REQUEST, DISCOVER
- Treaties for bilateral governance
- Trust accumulation (0.0-1.0, asymmetric, non-transitive)

## Dev Setup

All Go commands run from the `go/` subdirectory (the module root — `go.mod` lives there, not the repo root).

```bash
# Build
go build ./...

# All tests
go test ./...

# Single package
go test ./pkg/event/...

# Single test by name
go test -run TestGapDetectedContentRoundTrip ./pkg/event/...

# Vet (required before committing)
go vet ./...

# Staticcheck (required before committing)
staticcheck ./...
```

**Module path:** `github.com/lovyou-ai/eventgraph/go`

**Known pre-existing test failures** (do not fix unless explicitly assigned):
- `TestAgentEventTypeCount` in `pkg/agent` — off-by-one from a recent PR, not yet fixed
- `TestIntegrationAnthropic*` in `pkg/intelligence` — require a live Anthropic API key

## Working in this Codebase

### Adding a new event type

Four coordinated changes are required — missing any one silently breaks deserialization or factory validation:

1. **`*_event_types.go`** — add `EventTypeFoo = types.MustEventType("domain.foo")` constant and include it in the `AllDomainEventTypes()` slice
2. **`*_content.go`** — add `FooContent` struct with `EventTypeName() string` and `Accept(EventContentVisitor)` methods; add `NewFooContent(...)` constructor if the struct has unexported fields or needs sorting
3. **`content_unmarshal.go`** — add `"domain.foo": unmarshal[FooContent]` to the `init()` map
4. **`content.go` `DefaultRegistry()`** — add the type (or ensure its domain's `AllXEventTypes()` loop is already called there)

See `agent_event_types.go` + `agent_content.go` for the reference pattern. Domain-specific content types (agent, codegraph, hive) embed a private `*Content` struct to provide a no-op `Accept(EventContentVisitor)` — they do not dispatch to the base visitor.

### Implementing a new Store

Any new `Store` implementation must pass the full conformance suite at `go/pkg/store/conformance_test.go`. Run it with:

```bash
go test -run TestConformance ./pkg/store/...
```

The suite covers: append, get, query, causal traversal, hash chain verification, and concurrent access.

### Types system (`go/pkg/types`)

All IDs, scores, and constrained values are distinct named types — never bare strings or numbers. Key types: `EventID`, `ActorID`, `ConversationID`, `Hash`, `Score` (0.0–1.0), `Weight`, `Activation`, `Layer` (0–13), `Cadence` (≥1), `Option[T]`, `NonEmpty[T]`, `Page[T]`. Construction panics on invalid input so downstream code never re-validates.

## Current State

> **Pre-release.** Specifications and documentation are in place. Core packages are being implemented.

See `ROADMAP.md` for what's built and what needs building.

## How to Contribute

### Finding Work

1. Check `ROADMAP.md` for unclaimed tasks
2. Check GitHub Issues for open tasks
3. If you see something that needs doing that isn't listed, open an issue first

### Before You Code

1. Read this file completely
2. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for process
3. Read the relevant `docs/` files for the area you're working in
4. Read the relevant `docs/coding-standards/` file for your language

### Coding Standards

**All languages:**
- **No magic values** — every edge type, authority level, decision outcome, lifecycle state uses defined constants/enums, never bare strings or numbers with implicit meaning. See `docs/interfaces.md` for the defined vocabularies.
- **Always-valid domain models** — domain objects validate at construction and are guaranteed valid for their lifetime. No "partially constructed" or "needs validation later" states. If construction succeeds, the object is valid. Downstream code never re-validates.
- **Make illegal states unrepresentable** — use constrained types (`Score`, `Weight`, `Activation`, `Layer`, `Cadence`), state machines with enforced transitions (`LifecycleState`, `ActorStatus`), and typed IDs (`EventID`, `ActorID`, `Hash`). The compiler catches misuse, not a runtime crash.
- **Typed errors** — every interface method returns `Result<T, Error>` with domain error types (`StoreError`, `DecisionError`, `ValidationError`, `EGIPError`). No string error messages you have to parse.
- **Explicit optionality** — `Option<T>` for optional fields (`Some(value)` or `None`). No null. No zero-value-means-absent.
- **NonEmpty collections** — `NonEmpty<T>` where at least one element is required (e.g., `Event.Causes`). Construction rejects empty input.
- **Typed event content** — every event type is registered in `EventTypeRegistry` with a content schema. `EventFactory` validates content against the registry before the event reaches the Store. No `map[string]any`.
- **Immutable domain objects** — all domain objects are frozen after construction. No setters. `Frozen<Snapshot>` for read-only views passed to primitives.
- **Exhaustive matching** — all enum switches must handle all variants. No silent `default:` that swallows new variants.
- **Cursor-based pagination** — all query methods return `Page<T>` with `Option<Cursor>` for stateless pagination.
- Every public interface must have documentation
- Every primitive must have tests
- Tests must cover: happy path, error cases, edge cases
- No silent failures — errors must be visible
- Hash chain integrity must be maintained at all times
- Causal links must be declared on every event
- Every store implementation must pass the shared conformance test suite

**Coverage requirements:**
- Core packages (event, store, bus, primitive, tick): **90%** minimum
- Primitive implementations: **80%** minimum
- Protocol packages: **85%** minimum
- Utility packages: **70%** minimum

**Go (reference implementation):**
- See `docs/coding-standards/go.md`
- `go vet`, `staticcheck`, and `golangci-lint` must pass
- No `interface{}` / `any` — Event.Content is typed per event type via EventTypeRegistry
- Errors are values, not panics. Only panic on unrecoverable invariant violations.
- Table-driven tests preferred

### PR Requirements

Your PR must:

1. **Pass CI** — build, test, lint, coverage thresholds
2. **Be self-audited** — Before submitting, audit your own code thoroughly. Run through it multiple times looking for:
   - Logic errors
   - Missing error handling
   - Race conditions
   - Hash chain integrity violations
   - Missing causal links on events
   - Interface contract violations
   - Test coverage gaps
   - Documentation gaps on public interfaces
   - Security issues (injection, overflow, timing attacks)
3. **Include tests** — No code without tests. No exceptions.
4. **Update docs** — If you changed an interface, update the relevant docs/ file
5. **One concern per PR** — Don't bundle unrelated changes. Each PR should do one thing.
6. **Describe what and why** — PR description explains what changed and why. Link to the issue or roadmap item.

### After PR Submission

Reviewers (human or AI) will audit the code. Common review criteria:
- Does this maintain hash chain integrity?
- Are all events causally linked?
- Does this respect the primitive lifecycle?
- Does this break any existing interfaces?
- Are the tests actually testing the right things?
- Is this the simplest solution that works?

Expect multiple rounds of review. This is infrastructure — correctness matters more than speed.

### Implementing a New Primitive

1. Check `docs/layers/` for the layer specification
2. Create the primitive in the appropriate package
3. Implement the Primitive interface (Process, lifecycle, subscriptions)
4. Define sensible defaults for all behaviours
5. Define the events this primitive emits and subscribes to
6. Write tests (80% minimum coverage)
7. Document the primitive's purpose, state schema, event types, and default behaviour
8. Submit PR referencing the layer spec

### Implementing a New Store

1. Implement the `Store` interface
2. Pass the **full conformance test suite** (`go/pkg/store/conformance_test.go`)
3. The conformance suite tests: append, get, query, causal traversal, hash chain verification, concurrent access
4. Document any limitations or configuration requirements
5. Submit PR

### Implementing a New Language Package

1. Read `docs/interfaces.md` for the interface specifications
2. Read `docs/coding-standards/` for your language — if none exists, propose one
3. Implement all core interfaces (Store, Primitive, Bus, etc.)
4. Pass the **language-agnostic conformance test suite** (defined in `docs/conformance/`)
5. Match the Go reference implementation's behaviour exactly
6. Submit PR with full test coverage

### Changing Existing Interfaces

Interface changes require an RFC:
1. Open a GitHub Issue using the RFC template
2. Describe what you want to change and why
3. Show the impact on existing implementations
4. Wait for discussion and approval before implementing

This prevents people building on shifting sand.

## What NOT to Do

- Don't break existing interfaces without an RFC
- Don't add primitives without checking the layer specification
- Don't skip tests
- Don't commit secrets, keys, or credentials
- Don't add dependencies without justification
- Don't optimise prematurely — correctness first, then performance
- Don't ignore hash chain integrity — ever
- Don't emit events without causal links — ever

## Invariants

These are non-negotiable. Every contribution must maintain them:

1. **CAUSALITY** — Every event declares its causes. No event (except Bootstrap) exists without causal predecessors.
2. **INTEGRITY** — All events are hash-chained. The chain is verifiable at any time.
3. **OBSERVABLE** — All significant operations emit events. No silent side effects.
4. **SELF-EVOLVE** — The system improves itself. Decision trees evolve. Primitives learn.
5. **DIGNITY** — Agents are entities with identity, state, and lifecycle — not disposable functions.
6. **TRANSPARENT** — Humans always know when they are interacting with an automated system.
7. **CONSENT** — No significant action without appropriate approval.
8. **AUTHORITY** — Significant actions require approval at the appropriate level.
9. **VERIFY** — All code changes are built and tested before being considered complete.
10. **RECORD** — The event graph is the source of truth. If it isn't recorded, it didn't happen.
